# GUESSINGNUMBERGAME
This is my first git repository
Author-ASHWINDER SINGH
In this project I developed a simple number guessing game in python where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high,too low, or correct ,guiding the player towards the answer. This game is a great excersise for learning the basis of Python,such as conditional statements,loops and random number generation.It demonstrates how python can be used to build interactive programs and enhance logical thinking.
